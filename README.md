# Virtual Coach Web Application

## Overview
This project is a web application designed to monitor and assist users during their workout sessions, specifically focusing on exercises like squats and push-ups. Using computer vision technologies and pose estimation, the app provides real-time feedback on the user's form and count repetitions. The backend is built with Flask, and the pose detection utilizes OpenCV and Mediapipe.

## Prerequisites
- Flask
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Mediapipe

## Features
- **Real-time Exercise Monitoring**: Tracks user movements through a webcam feed to count exercise repetitions and provide feedback on form correctness.
- **Exercise Selection**: Allows users to select the type of exercise they wish to perform.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Visual feedback through the webcam feed indicating correct or incorrect posture during exercises.
